# Format: AppName,/Path/To/App1.app[,/Path/To/App2.app,...]
# This file is used by setup.sh to monitor application installation progress.
# Each line defines one application and the full paths to one or more .app bundles that must be detected in the install.log.
# 
# IMPORTANT:
# The first column (AppName) must exactly match the list item "title" used in swiftdialog.json.
# This ensures SwiftDialog UI updates correctly for each monitored application.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# Example:
# Company Portal,/Applications/Company Portal.app

Company Portal,/Applications/Company Portal.app
Microsoft Office 365,/Applications/Microsoft Word.app,/Applications/Microsoft Excel.app,/Applications/Microsoft PowerPoint.app,/Applications/Microsoft OneNote.app,/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app,/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app,/Applications/OneDrive.app
